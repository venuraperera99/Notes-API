# Project Title

Secure and scalable REST API backend system that allows users to create, read, update, and delete notes.

## Technologies Used

- **Express.js**: A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database that provides high performance, high availability, and easy scalability.
- **Mongoose**: A library for MongoDB and Node.js.

## Why Express.js?

Express.js was chosen for this project because of its simplicity, flexibility, and widely adopted nature in the Node.js community. It allows for easy and fast development of web applications with a minimalistic approach.

## Why MongoDB?

MongoDB was chosen as the database solution due to its scalability, flexibility in handling unstructured data, and ease of integration with Node.js. It provides a schema-less data model, making it suitable for projects with evolving data requirements.

## Project Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone 
   cd <cloned repo>
2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
    npm install
   
3. **Run the Application**

    ```bash
     npm start
    ```
The server will start, and you can access the application at http://localhost:3000 or the port you specified.

## Test Using Postman
most of the testing was done using postman and copying the token from logging in and using it as the authentication token for all other requests.

**Running Tests**

Unit Tests

```bash
npm run test:unit
```

Replace placeholders like `your-username`, `your-repository`, `your_mongodb_connection_uri`, and others with your actual information.
